# Rapid WhatsApp

Rapid WhatsApp is a React-based project that simplifies the process of starting a conversation on WhatsApp without having to save a contact's number in your phone's contacts list. The project allows users to enter a phone number directly into the app, click on "chat," and then be taken directly to that person's WhatsApp chat window without the need to save their number in their phone's contacts list. Additionally, Rapid WhatsApp includes the ability to save contacts directly in your browser's local storage.
